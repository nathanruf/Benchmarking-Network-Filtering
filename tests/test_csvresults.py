"""
Sanity tests for the network filtering benchmark pipeline.

These tests exercise the current pipeline end-to-end on a handful of small
graphs (a few real networks and small n=100 Watts-Strogatz graphs) instead
of relying on pre-generated result CSVs.

The previous version of this file asserted against
results/realNetsResults.csv and results/simulatedNetsResults.csv using a
schema (`filename` column, a `bench_net2net_filtering` benchmark name, and
short indicator column names such as `information_retention`/`jaccard`
straight in the row) that predates the current netfilterbench package.
Today, run_experiment() produces rows keyed by `graph_name`, and scalar
indicators keep the function's own name (e.g.
`calculate_information_retention`) as their column, so those old
assumptions no longer hold. Running small experiments directly, rather
than reading old CSVs, keeps these tests correct as the package evolves
and does not depend on any specific benchmark run having been executed
first.
